## üîí Security

### Current Implementation
- Supabase authentication for user management
- Session-based access control
- Role-based authorization (user/admin)
- Protected routes with authentication checks
- Admin-only endpoints with role verification

### Production Recommendations
‚ö†Ô∏è **This is an MVP/Prototype** - Before going to production:

1. Enable email verification in Supabase
2. Add rate limiting to API endpoints
3. Implement CAPTCHA on forms
4. Set up proper email notification service
5. Add comprehensive input validation
6. Implement proper error logging
7. Review and tighten security policies
8. Add GDPR compliance features
9. Set up monitoring and alerts
10. Implement backup strategy

## üì± Usage Examples

### As a Customer (Guest)
1. Visit the homepage
2. Fill out the quote form (no account needed)
3. Receive quote confirmation
4. Optional: Create account to track quote status

2. Submit quote from homepage
3. Visit dashboard to see all your quotes
4. Track status changes in real-time

### As an Admin

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Local Development
The app uses hash-based routing (`#/path`) so it works without a server.

### Adding Features
- **New API Endpoint**: Add to `/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx`
- **New Page**: Create in `/pages/` and add route to `/App.tsx`
- **New Component**: Add to `/components/`
- **New Utility**: Add to `/utils/`

### Testing Tips
1. Create multiple test accounts
2. Submit quotes from different accounts
3. Test admin features with filters
4. Test responsive design at different breakpoints
5. Test authentication flows (signup, login, logout)
